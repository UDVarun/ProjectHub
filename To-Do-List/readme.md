# To-Do List

A simple and interactive To-Do List web application to manage your daily tasks efficiently. The app allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. All tasks are stored locally using `localStorage`, so your data persists even after refreshing the page.

- **Mark as Complete:** Click the "Complete" button to mark a task as completed (strikethrough style).
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove a task by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they remain after page reloads.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes with a modern UI.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure of the application.
